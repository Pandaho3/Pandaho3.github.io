- Stateless
- optional layer of security
- acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in / out of one or more subnets.
- set up network ACLs with rules that are similar to your security groups.
- Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL.
  - the subnet is automatically associated with the default NACL.
  - default NACL. (All allow)
  - New NACL (all deny)
  - associate a network ACL with multiple subnets;
  - however, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time.
  - When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.
- A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, each rule can either allow or deny traffic.

  - default network ACL: **allows all inbound and outbound IPv4/IPv6 traffic**.
  - `Rule *`: denies all traffic.
  - `Rule 100`: allows all traffic.
- stateless
  - no information about a request is maintained after a request is processed.
- A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule. The highest number that you can use for a rule is 32,766.
