# Subnet

- a range of IP addresses in a VPC.
- A subsection, segments, or partitions of a network. Divided by CIDR range.
- **Subnets can only belong to a single Availability Zone**.
  - can't span across Availability Zones.
- Subnets are generally classified as public or private.
  - Public subnets have direct access to the internet
  - private subnet do not.


- IP addressing
- When you create VPC, you specify its set of IP addresses with `Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation`.
  - After create a VPC, cannot change the address range
  - CIDR notation is a simplified way to show a specific range of IP addresses.
  - example: 10.0.0.0/16.
    - IP addresses enable resources in VPC to communicate with each other and with resources over the internet.
- The IPv4 CIDR block:
  - large as /16 (2^16, or 65,536 addresses)
  - small as /28 (2^4, or 16 addresses)
- associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and subnets, and assign IPv6 addresses from that block to the resources in your VPC.
  - IPv6 CIDR blocks have a different block size limit.

- The CIDR block of a subnet = the CIDR block for a VPC.
  - the VPC and the subnet are the same size (a single subnet in the VPC).
- the CIDR block of a subnet can be a subset < the CIDR block for the VPC.
  - This structure enables multiple subnets.
  - create more than one subnet in a VPC, the CIDR blocks of the subnets cannot overlap. You cannot have duplicate IP addresses in the same VPC.


- AWS reserves these IP addresses:
  - `10.0.0.0` : Network address
  - `10.0.0.1` : VPC local router (internal communications)
  - `10.0.0.2` : Domain Name System (DNS) resolution
  - `10.0.0.3` : Future use
  - `10.0.0.255` : Network broadcast address
  - these five IP addresses are automatically reserved on every network range.


- how to divide subnets.
  - Subnets should be used to define internet accessibility, so there might not good to have more than one public and one private subnet per Availability Zone.

    - `all resources that require direct access internet` would go into the **public subnet**,
      - (public-facing load balancers, NAT instances, bastion hosts, etc)
    - **all other instances would go into your private subnet**.
    - Exception: resources that require absolutely no access to the internet, either directly or indirectly.
      - These resources would go into a separate private subnet.
  - use subnets to create layers of separation between "tiers" of resources
    - such as putt backend application instances and data resources into separate private subnets.
    - requires accurately predict how many hosts will need in each subnet,
    - more likely run out of IP addresses more quickly,
    - or leave too many IP addresses unused when they could be used elsewhere.
    - Subnets can provide a very basic element of segregation between resources by using a NACL rules.
    - security groups can provide even more fine-grained level of traffic control between resources
    - without the risk of overcomplicating your infrastructure and wasting or running out of IP addresses.
    - With this approach, you just need to anticipate how many public and how many private IP addresses your VPC needs, and use other resources to create segregation between resources within a subnet.
  - **Allocate substantially more IP adress for private subnets than for public subnets**:

    - The majority of resources on AWS can be hosted in private subnets
    - `using public subnets for controlled access` to and from the internet as necessary.
    - always need more private IP addresses than public IP addresses 
      - because the more resources you expose to the internet, the more vulnerable you become.
      - protect IP resources by placing them in a private subnet.
    - When you plan architecture, anticipate how many hosts your VPC might need, how many of those hosts can be placed in private subnets.


## Subnet sizes:

- Recommended: consider larger subnets over smaller ones, such as /24 and larger. 
- **Choose larger range of IP ranges than smaller range**.
  - `simplifies workload placement`.
    - place a workload among 10 small subnets is more complicated than place the same workload with one large subnet.
  - `less likely to waste or run out of IP addresses`.
    - subnet runs out of available IP addresses, can't add more IP addresses to that subnet.
    - For example, if you have 251 IP addresses in a subnet that's using only 25 of them, you can't share the unused 226 IP addresses with another subnet that's running out.
    - Consider where you will be five years down the road because this will save you a lot of time.
    - no necessary to limit Address Resolution Protocol, ARP, broadcast domains because this is solved by the VPC


## Subnet types:

- private
  - web-tier instances:
    - private subnets that are behind a load balancer placed in a public subnet.
    - If require web application instances to be attached to Elastic IP addresses directly, even though you can also attach an Elastic IP address to a load balancer. In those cases, web application instances would need to be in a public subnet.
  - Data store instances
  - Batch processing instances
  - Backend instances


Public / Private subnet
- **public subnet**:
    - routed to an <kbd>internet gateway</kbd>
      -  include `a routing table entry to an internet gateway`
      -  The subnet route table has an attached Internet Gateway.
      -  to support inbound or outbound access to the public Internet.
    - “Auto-assign public IPv4 address” set to “Yes”.
      - every instance in VPC gets a public IP address automatically
      - can also request a public IP address to be assigned when create the instance by modifying the subnet’s auto-assign public IP address properties.

- **private subnet**:
    - does not have a route to an <kbd>internet gateway</kbd>
      - do not have a routing table entry to an internet gateway
    - Not directly accessible from the Public subnets.
    - If you private subnet requires internet access
      - for example: to download security patches for applications, 
      - use a "jump box" to support the restricted, outbound-only public internet access.
      - A “jump box”: `NAT, proxy, or bastion host`.


- **VPN-only subnet**
    - subnet doesn’t have a route to the <kbd>internet gateway</kbd>
    - but has traffic routed to a <kbd>virtual private gateway</kbd> for a `VPN connection`

- Subnets should be used to define which parts of the network are accessible to the internet, and which parts are not.

- Rather than defining subnets based on application or functional tier—such as web, application, data, etc.
    - it’s recommended that organize subnets based on internet accessibility.
    - to define clear, subnet-level isolation between public and private resources.
